- 👋 Hi, I’m @tomrembrown
- 👀 I’m interested in Vue.js, Node, TypeScript, SCSS, and JavaScript development in general. I live in Toronto, Canada with my boyfriend and our two cats. I have a mixed background - having studied physics, public administration, and web development. I've worked as a research assistant and research analyst, as a programmer, primarily doing physics-related programming in MatLab, and as a policy analyst and business analyst for the federal government. I have a strong interest in spirituality and meditation and I also like to jog. 
- 🌱 I’m currently following a course on Udemy about Node development. I have built REST APIs in Node before - but I want to deepen my knowledge of this.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a project to build a more healthy social networking site. Although sites such as Facebook, Twitter, etc... do help people build and maintain connections, there have been a number of problems raised with them. I'm wondering if using a different business model and philosophy could lead to a social networking site with the advantages of the current ones without the problems (increasing isolation, anxiety, lack of focus, etc...)
- 📫 The best way to reach me is to contact me at tombrown654321@protonmail.com.
